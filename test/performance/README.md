|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|
| **BASE_URL**                         | The base URL for the application, used for API calls and resource fetching. | Yes      | N/A     |
| **STAGE_DURATION**                   | The total duration of each stage in the performance testing process, measured in seconds. | Yes      | N/A     |
| **STRESS_LOAD_MIN_ITER_PER_SEC**    | The minimum number of iterations per second during stress load testing.    | Yes      | N/A     |
| **STRESS_LOAD_MAX_ITER_PER_SEC**    | The maximum number of iterations per second during stress load testing.    | Yes      | N/A     |
| **STRESS_LOAD_DURATION_95**         | The 95th percentile duration of stress load tests, indicating the time taken for 95% of the requests. | Yes      | N/A     |
| **AUTOSCALING_MAX_ITER_PER_SEC**    | The maximum iterations per second allowed during autoscaling operations.    | Yes      | N/A     |
| **AUTOSCALING_DURATION_95**         | The 95th percentile duration for autoscaling events, reflecting the time taken for 95% of autoscaling actions. | Yes      | N/A     |
| **AVERAGE_LOAD_ITER_PER_SEC**       | The average number of iterations per second during normal load conditions.  | Yes      | N/A     |
| **AVERAGE_LOAD_ITER_VARIATION**     | The variation in iterations per second during average load conditions, indicating stability or fluctuations. | Yes      | N/A     |
| **AVERAGE_LOAD_DURATION_95**        | The 95th percentile duration for average load conditions, showing the time taken for 95% of requests under normal load. | Yes      | N/A     |
| **PREALLOACATED_VUS**                | The number of virtual users preallocated for performance testing, used to simulate load conditions. | No      | 150     |
| **SKIP_TLS_VERIFY**                  | A flag to skip TLS verification during API calls, useful for testing in development environments. | No       | False   |
